description: "This digital collection documents early representations of queer identities in vaudeville entertainment (1880s-1930s), focusing on male and female impersonators who achieved mainstream celebrity during this era. The collection includes 21 objects (postcards, photographs, sheet music, paintings, and advertisements) featuring performers including Julian Eltinge, Karyl Norman, Bert Savoy, Vesta Tilley, Bothwell Browne, Della Fox, Bert Errol, and Ella Wesner. Curated from multiple GLAM repositories including the Digital Transgender Archive, New York Public Library, and others, this collection documents a brief historical moment of mainstream queer visibility before systematic erasure began through the 1934 Production Code and legal persecution. By aggregating these dispersed materials into a freely accessible interface, we reclaim narratives that dominant institutions attempted to silence, serving LGBTQ+ communities, educators, and researchers with primary sources demonstrating queer people have always been present in public cultural life."
