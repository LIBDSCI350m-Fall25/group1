bertsavoy_cbm_image_painting_1923,bertsavoy_cbm_image_painting_1923.jpg,Bert Savoy - Calla Lillies ,Charles Demouth,1927,“Charles Demuth’s painting is both a still life and a memorial portrait commemorating Bert Savoy a vaudeville entertainer famous for performances as a female impersonator. Savoy was struck by lightning on a Long Island beach in 1923. The shell and dark waves allude to the site of Savoy’s death and the calla lilies are associated with funerals. Many modern artists used flowers to signify themes of sexuality and gender expression. Thus the painting reflects Savoy and Demuth’s kinship in New York queer circles during the early twentieth century.”,Bert Savoy,New York (United States),https://crystalbridges.emuseum.com/objects/2972/calla-lilies-bert-savoy,asc201253,Still Image,image/jpeg,English,Copyrights undertermined,https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/,image,"""A painting of two white cala lilies.
