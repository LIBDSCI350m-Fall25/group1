# Data Management Plan

Data Management Plan
DMP Requirements

### Project Description

This digital collection project presents photos and artistic renderings of early representations of queer identities in popular entertainment forms such as theater and vaudeville. Its primary focus is on popular male and female impersonators who achieved notable success during the early 20th century in the United States. The collection includes postcards, publicity photographs, sheet music, and drawings curated from several GLAM repositories, including the Digital Transgender Archive, the New York Public Library Digital Collections, and the Queer Music Heritage Archive. Our goal is to create a cohesive portrayal of performers who defined their era and contributed to the visibility of queer expression in mainstream culture.

### Roles and Responsibilities*

    Explain how data management responsibilities are coordinated across your group. Partner names are not required on the final DMP assignment because the GitHub page is technically public.

### Anticipated Data

    The DMP should describe the types of data produced during the project and matters such as:
        include all file types used in the site, list license selected for site and discuss licenses groupings for digital objects
        Include a brief description of data volume in MB here, grouped by file type
        the way your data was generated or acquired
        document the data associated with the project:

### Documentation and Metadata

    What type of metadata will accompany this data? Where and how can users access this metadata?
        Hint: Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation! Where and how do you plan on provide it to your audience?

### Storage and Backup

    Describe resources, repositories, and platforms used to preserve your data during the project.
        Hint: This should include Google Drive, GitHub, and any storage on your personal computers.

### Data Sharing

    How will you share your data? What will you make available?
    Could others want to reuse your data? In what ways?
    Do you plan on archiving your data in an external repository? (This is not a requirement!)

### Period of Data Retention

    This section should address how long your group plans to maintain each component of the project before and after it has been submitted for grading.
    If you plan to maintain the project after the term ends, what is your contingency plan if a component of the project goes down?

### Licensing and Ethical Issues

    Use this section to outline the intellectual property rights of your created material.  What are the terms under which others may use these materials? If your data and products raise any potential ethics issues, use this section to address those matters.

### Appendix: Data Dictionary

    Your data dictionary is a key to your metadata. It is organized as a table documenting fields in your group’s CollectionBuilder spreadsheet.
    Your data dictionary should have as many items as used fields in your CollectionBuilder metadata spreadsheet.
    You do not need to alter the standard definitions of fields required by CollectionBuilder.
    Did you created your own fields? Use the location field in a specific context? Have a naming standard for your items? This is the place to (briefly) document those decisions.
