# Data Management Plan

Data Management Plan
DMP Requirements

### Project Description

This digital collection uses CollectionBuilder, an open-source framework for creating digital collection websites from metadata stored in Google Sheets and digital objects hosted on GitHub. Our project documents early representations of queer identities in popular entertainment through photographs, postcards, sheet music, and artistic renderings of male and female impersonators from approximately 1880-1934. The collection aggregates materials from multiple GLAM repositories including the Digital Transgender Archive, New York Public Library Digital Collections, JD Doyle Archives, and Queer Music Heritage Archive. By bringing together these dispersed archival materials in a single, searchable interface, the project serves LGBTQ+ community members, educators, students, and researchers seeking primary source materials that document queer visibility in mainstream entertainment during periods of social repression. The CollectionBuilder platform offers interpretive visualization features including timeline views, geographic mapping, and subject browsing while maintaining long-term sustainability through static site generation. The site is freely available online with no authentication barriers, hosted on GitHub Pages, and accessible to anyone with internet access.

### Roles and Responsibilities*

Data management responsibilities are distributed across five specialized roles. The Project Manager coordinates activities, leads quality reviews, manages Google Drive, and submits deliverables. The Collection Development Manager makes final decisions about object inclusion and writes collection descriptions. The Object Preservation Manager oversees storage organization, establishes file naming standards, and ensures backup copies exist. The Metadata Manager coordinates cataloging of all 21 objects, ensures adherence to the metadata application profile with 21 defined fields, and maintains the master spreadsheet. The Repository Manager validates technical requirements, manages GitHub setup, and troubleshoots platform issues.
If team members become unavailable, the Project Manager assumes Repository Manager duties with Object Preservation Manager guidance, and the Metadata Manager assumes Project Manager coordination. All members access complete materials through Google Drive and GitHub.

### Anticipated Data

The collection consists of 21 JPEG files, including 10 sheet music covers, 7 photographs, 2 postcards, 1 painting reproduction, and 1 advertisement. The metadata CSV is under 1 MB, and documentation files total 2-3 MB. Complete project size including CollectionBuilder code is approximately 50-70 MB.
All objects are historical materials from circa 1870-1930. Rights status uses RightsStatements.org URIs: 18 objects are "Copyright Undetermined" (http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/) and 3 are "No Copyright - United States" (http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/). The CollectionBuilder site and our original metadata, documentation, and data dictionary are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), enabling reuse with attribution.
Objects were acquired through systematic research using GLAM resources to identify performers, then downloading highest-resolution files from institutional repositories. Files were renamed using our standard convention: performer_archive_objecttype_description_year.jpg. 

### Documentation and Metadata

The collection has produced a significant amount of metadata that has been tracked, documented and applied in accordance with a group-developed Metadata Application Profile (MAP). The MAP ensures that users cataloging items in the collection know what information to include and how to format it, resulting in consistent description across all items. The consistency supports clarity, browsability and reproducibility, while ensuring the collection remains usable and accessible to its intended audience. The guidelines also ensure that all metadata meets CollectionBuilder’s data entry and formatting standards so the site can function properly. For reference, the CollectionBuilder documentation on CSV metadata and metadata formatting was used to inform and maintain these standards. Users can access the metadata via the “” section on our collection website.

### Storage and Backup

Our data is shared via a jekyll-built CollectionBuilder website hosted by GitHub Pages. We are making available the digital objects, including the JPG/JPEG image file of the object and the metadata, which contain citations from the source GLAMs. 
Others may want to reuse our data to conduct historical research into American Vaudeville; personal, academic, or other reasons must fall in accordance with copyright and within licensed use which is explicitly stated within the metadata fields. 
Our data is going to be additionally archived in a Google Drive in accordance with the next subsection.

Our data is going to be additionally archived in a Google Drive. For editing access to the Google Drive, please reach out to the admin attached to the Drive.

### Period of Data Retention

During Fall 2025, all components are actively maintained across three storage tiers. The metadata spreadsheet is continuously updated with weekly GitHub syncs. Quality reviews identify and correct errors.
The GitHub repository will likely remain accessible indefinitely as CollectionBuilder's static architecture requires no ongoing maintenance. If GitHub discontinues free hosting, any member can fork the repository or migrate to alternative platforms. If UO accounts are deactivated, the Project Manager will coordinate transfer to personal accounts 30 days in advance. If team members become unavailable, documented procedures in Google Drive enable continuity.

### Licensing and Ethical Issues

The photos and artwork we used were from public collections that we cited and we made sure to include all the information provided to us from the original collections. We included a rights statement for protection. The images we chose are public domain. The photos we included are not culturally insensitive and do not include Indigenous communities, enslaved people, children, patients or institutionalized individuals. The only concern is that these images will be taken out of context as they are images of female and male impersonators. This is the risk when posting in public collections. These are public domain images so they do risk being used as images of marginalized people without community involvement or the use of sensitive historical photographs in marketing.

### Appendix: Data Dictionary

    Your data dictionary is a key to your metadata. It is organized as a table documenting fields in your group’s CollectionBuilder spreadsheet.
    Your data dictionary should have as many items as used fields in your CollectionBuilder metadata spreadsheet.
    You do not need to alter the standard definitions of fields required by CollectionBuilder.
    Did you created your own fields? Use the location field in a specific context? Have a naming standard for your items? This is the place to (briefly) document those decisions.
