# Data Management Plan

Data Management Plan
DMP Requirements

### Project Description

This digital collection uses CollectionBuilder, an open-source framework for creating digital collection websites from metadata stored in Google Sheets and digital objects hosted on GitHub. Our project documents early representations of queer identities in popular entertainment through photographs, postcards, sheet music, and artistic renderings of male and female impersonators from approximately 1880-1934. The collection aggregates materials from multiple GLAM repositories including the Digital Transgender Archive, New York Public Library Digital Collections, University of Arizona Special Collections, University of Utah Digital Library, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and Queer Music Heritage Archive. By bringing together these dispersed archival materials in a single, searchable interface, the project serves LGBTQ+ community members, educators, students, and researchers seeking primary source materials that document queer visibility in mainstream entertainment during periods of social repression. The CollectionBuilder platform offers interpretive visualization features including timeline views, geographic mapping, and subject browsing while maintaining long-term sustainability through static site generation. The site is freely available online with no authentication barriers, hosted on GitHub Pages, and accessible to anyone with internet access.

### Roles and Responsibilities*

Data management responsibilities are distributed across five specialized roles. The Project Manager coordinates activities, leads quality reviews, manages Google Drive, and submits deliverables. The Collection Development Manager makes final decisions about object inclusion and writes collection descriptions. The Object Preservation Manager oversees storage organization, establishes file naming standards, and ensures backup copies exist. The Metadata Manager coordinates cataloging of all 21 objects, ensures adherence to the metadata application profile with 21 defined fields, and maintains the master spreadsheet. The Repository Manager validates technical requirements, manages GitHub setup, and troubleshoots platform issues.
If team members become unavailable, the Project Manager assumes Repository Manager duties with Object Preservation Manager guidance, and the Metadata Manager assumes Project Manager coordination. All members access complete materials through Google Drive and GitHub.

### Anticipated Data

The collection consists of 21 JPEG files, including 10 sheet music covers, 7 photographs, 2 postcards, 1 painting reproduction, and 1 advertisement. The metadata CSV is under 1 MB, and documentation files total 2-3 MB. Complete project size including CollectionBuilder code is approximately 50-70 MB.
All objects are historical materials from circa 1870-1930. Rights status uses RightsStatements.org URIs: 18 objects are "Copyright Undetermined" (http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/) and 3 are "No Copyright - United States" (http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/). The CollectionBuilder site and our original metadata, documentation, and data dictionary are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), enabling reuse with attribution.
Objects were acquired through systematic research using GLAM resources to identify performers, then downloading highest-resolution files from institutional repositories. Files were renamed using our standard convention: performer_archive_objecttype_description_year.jpg. 

### Documentation and Metadata

    What type of metadata will accompany this data? Where and how can users access this metadata?
        Hint: Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation! Where and how do you plan on provide it to your audience?

### Storage and Backup

    Describe resources, repositories, and platforms used to preserve your data during the project.
        Hint: This should include Google Drive, GitHub, and any storage on your personal computers.

### Data Sharing

Our data is shared via a jekyll-built CollectionBuilder website hosted by GitHub Pages. We are making available the digital objects, including the JPG/JPEG image file of the object and the metadata, which contain citations from the source GLAMs. 
Others may want to reuse our data to conduct historical research into American Vaudeville; personal, academic, or other reasons must fall in accordance with copyright and within licensed use which is explicitly stated within the metadata fields. 
Our data is going to be additionally archived in a Google Drive. For editing access to the Google Drive, please reach out to the admin attached to the Drive.

### Period of Data Retention

    This section should address how long your group plans to maintain each component of the project before and after it has been submitted for grading.
    If you plan to maintain the project after the term ends, what is your contingency plan if a component of the project goes down?

### Licensing and Ethical Issues

    Use this section to outline the intellectual property rights of your created material.  What are the terms under which others may use these materials? If your data and products raise any potential ethics issues, use this section to address those matters.

### Appendix: Data Dictionary

    Your data dictionary is a key to your metadata. It is organized as a table documenting fields in your group’s CollectionBuilder spreadsheet.
    Your data dictionary should have as many items as used fields in your CollectionBuilder metadata spreadsheet.
    You do not need to alter the standard definitions of fields required by CollectionBuilder.
    Did you created your own fields? Use the location field in a specific context? Have a naming standard for your items? This is the place to (briefly) document those decisions.
