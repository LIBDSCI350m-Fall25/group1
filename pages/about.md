## About the Collection

### Historical Context
Vaudevillian impersonation was a popular and influential part of entertainment from the late 1800s through the early 1930s. Male and female impersonation had much older theatrical roots—such as men playing all roles in Shakespeare’s era or gender tricks in pantomime, but vaudeville turned it into a mainstream stage specialty. A central characteristic of Vaudevillian performance was satire.

Male impersonators were women who performed as men, often adopting fashionable clothing, confident posture, and deep singing voices. Their acts ranged from satire to smooth, masculine personas. The popularity of male impersonators reflected broader cultural changes, especially shifting roles for women during the suffrage movement and World War I.  

One of the most famous female impersonators was Julian Eltinge, known for stunning feminine costume and poise, while others like Bert Savoy brought a flamboyant comedic style that helped shape later drag performance.   

In many major cities in the mid-1930s, laws, ordinances or police actions explicitly targeted female and male impersonators as part of efforts to regulate morality and entertainment. Performers found fewer mainstream venues; their acts became marginalized or confined to underground nightclubs.
