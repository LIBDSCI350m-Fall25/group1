## About the Collection

### Historical Context
Vaudevillian impersonation was popular and influential entertainment from the late 1800s through the early 1930s. While gender performance had older theatrical roots—men playing all roles in Shakespeare's era, gender tricks in pantomime—vaudeville transformed it into a mainstream stage specialty, with satire as a central characteristic.

Male impersonators were women who performed as men, adopting fashionable menswear, confident posture, and deep singing voices. Their acts ranged from sharp satire to smooth, masculine personas. The popularity of male impersonators reflected broader cultural changes, especially shifting gender roles during the suffrage movement and World War I. Performers like Vesta Tilley, Ella Wesner, and Della Fox commanded massive audiences and challenged Victorian restrictions on women's public presence. Female impersonators achieved extraordinary fame and commercial success during this era. Julian Eltinge became one of the highest-paid performers in vaudeville, known for stunning feminine costume and graceful poise. Bert Savoy brought flamboyant comedic style that helped shape later drag performance traditions. Karyl Norman, billed as "The Creole Fashion Plate," headlined major theaters and appeared on countless sheet music covers. These performers were celebrated artists, not curiosities—they commanded top billing and performed for presidents and royalty.

By the mid-1930s, this visibility abruptly ended. Laws, ordinances, and police actions in major cities explicitly targeted impersonators as part of efforts to regulate morality and entertainment. The 1934 Production Code effectively banned gender-nonconforming characters from film. Performers found fewer mainstream venues; their acts became marginalized or confined to underground nightclubs. This collection documents a brief historical moment of mainstream queer visibility before systematic erasure began—reclaiming narratives that dominant culture attempted to silence.
