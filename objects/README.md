# Data Dictionary

The data dictionary, created and agreed upon by group consensus, followed standards from both Collection Builder and other authorities, such as TGN (Thesaurus of Geographic Names) and RightsStatements.org. Our naming standards conform to the guidelines set by these authorities to ensure consistency. Each field in the dictionary specifies which authority it refers to. The only field that employed a pick list was the subject field since the nature of this field was very project-specific.
