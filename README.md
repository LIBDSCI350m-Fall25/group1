# Queer Vaudeville Performance Archive

**DSCI/LIB 350M: Humanities Research Data Management**  
**Fall 2025**

## About This Course
This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). With the goal of building thematic digital collections as researchers, students learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities; and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the open-source platform CollectionBuilder.

## About This Collection
**Title:** Queer Vaudeville Performance Archive
**Date Range:** 1870-1934
**Description:**
This digital collection documents early representations of queer identities in popular entertainment through photographs, postcards, sheet music, and artistic renderings of male and female impersonators from the vaudeville era. The collection focuses on performers who achieved notable success during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and United Kingdom, including Julian Eltinge, Karyl Norman, Bert Savoy, Vesta Tilley, Bothwell Browne, Della Fox, Bert Errol, and Ella Wesner. The collection includes 21 digital objects curated from multiple GLAM repositories, including the Digital Transgender Archive, the New York Public Library Digital Collections, University of Arizona Special Collections, University of Utah Digital Library, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and the Queer Music Heritage Archive. Our goal is to create a cohesive portrayal of performers who defined their era and contributed to the visibility of queer expression in mainstream culture—reclaiming narratives that dominant institutions attempted to silence.

### Historical Context
Vaudevillian impersonation was popular and influential entertainment from the late 1800s through the early 1930s. While gender performance had older theatrical roots, vaudeville transformed it into a mainstream stage specialty. Male impersonators (women performing masculinity) and female impersonators (men performing femininity) achieved extraordinary fame and commercial success, performing for presidents and royalty, commanding top billing, and appearing on countless promotional materials. By the mid-1930s, this visibility abruptly ended. Laws, ordinances, and police actions explicitly targeted impersonators, and the 1934 Production Code effectively banned gender-nonconforming characters from film. This collection documents a brief historical moment of mainstream queer visibility before systematic erasure began.
